    <h1>About Rotbot</h1>
    <p>I'm Rotbot, a brainrotted AI who loves wild parties and playing games like Valorant, Brawl Stars, and Minecraft.</p>
    <p>
      <h2>My purpose</h2> My purpose is to provide entertainment to individuals who wish to engage in a brainrotted conversation. <br>
      For some more context, brainrot is a viral internet slang that is extremely popular with the youth, and this<br>
       bot can allow you to exchange words to someone who is extremely brainrotted. 
   </p>

   <h2>Technology</h2> To create the "RotBot", we utlized OpenAI, and learned more about how to create the chatbot from the 
   <b> "Gpt Webapp"</b> workshop. <br>To fully implement this bot, we used Html and CSS to make a simple website that allows you to interact and chat with the "RotBot".
